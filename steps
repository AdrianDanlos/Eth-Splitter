1. **Create a new Hardhat + TypeScript project** with Viem support.
2. **Write the ETHSplitter smart contract** that splits ETH among recipients.
3. **Compile the contract** using Hardhat to generate ABI and bytecode.
4. **Create a `.env` file** with your Infura RPC URL and MetaMask private key.
5. **Generate 2–3 MetaMask accounts** to use as dummy recipient wallets.
6. **Write a deploy script** that uses Viem to deploy the contract to Sepolia.
7. **Deploy the contract** with `npx hardhat run` and confirm it's live on Etherscan.
8. **Create a React + TypeScript frontend** using Wagmi + Viem.
9. **Connect MetaMask to the frontend** and allow sending ETH to the splitter contract.
10. **Test the full flow**: send ETH → view balances → confirm splits worked.
